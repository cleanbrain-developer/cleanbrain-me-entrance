# Repository Structure

## Responsibility map

| Path | Owner responsibility | Must not become |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Human introduction, dev/build commands, navigation to canonical docs | Full design specification |
| `PROJECT.yaml` | Structured project identity and phase | Narrative architecture document |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex-compatible bootstrap adapter | Common policy source |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code bootstrap adapter | Duplicate of `AGENTS.md` |
| `.ai/constitution/` | Durable engineering and agent principles | Product feature requirements |
| `docs/product/` | Problem, users, goals, scope | Implementation instructions |
| `docs/architecture/` | Structure, boundaries, context model | Decision history |
| `docs/decisions/` | Significant decisions and rationale | Mutable current-state checklist |
| `docs/status/current-state.md` | Current phase, progress, next work | Permanent policy or changelog |
| `src/config/services.ts` | Service metadata (single source) | Presentation logic |
| `src/components/` | Presentation of service metadata | Service data definitions |

## Dependency direction

Adapters and summaries may point inward to authoritative documents. Authoritative documents do not depend on adapter wording or external conversation history.

```text
README ──────────────┐
AGENTS / CLAUDE ──────┼──> PROJECT.yaml + constitution + docs
current-state ────────┘                 │
                                         └──> accepted ADRs
```

`PROJECT.yaml` lists canonical locations for discovery but does not duplicate their narrative content.

## Directory policy

Add a directory only when a file has a real responsibility within it. `docs/guides/` is intentionally absent — this repository has no repeatable operational procedure that needs one yet, and it does not distribute the starter itself.

## Evolution rule

Before adding a top-level area or responsibility layer, confirm that an existing location cannot represent it. A change to the deployment boundary with `cleanbrain-me-infra`, or to the config-driven service metadata model, requires an ADR under `docs/decisions/`.
