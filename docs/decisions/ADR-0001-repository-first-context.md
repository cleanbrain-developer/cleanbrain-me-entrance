# ADR-0001: Repository-First Context

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-09
- Deciders: cleanbrain.developer

## Context

Development on this project happens across sessions and, potentially, across different coding agents (Claude Code, Codex-compatible agents). If project intent, architecture, and working state exist only in conversation history, they are lost when a session ends or the agent changes, forcing every new session to be re-briefed from scratch.

## Decision

Use the repository as the authoritative source of persistent project context.

- Structure project identity in `PROJECT.yaml`.
- Store durable principles in `.ai/constitution/`.
- Store product and architecture explanations under `docs/`.
- Store significant decisions and rationale in ADRs under `docs/decisions/`.
- Store working state in `docs/status/current-state.md`.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` as thin agent-specific adapters that load the shared core.
- Treat conversations that shaped this repository (including the one that produced this ADR) as bootstrap input only, not a long-term dependency, once their decisions are persisted here.

## Consequences

### Positive

- New sessions and different agents can continue work without previous conversations.
- Shared policy has one source, reducing adapter drift between `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Decisions, working state, and task prompts have separate lifetimes and responsibilities.

### Costs and risks

- Code and documentation must be maintained together, or the repository stops being trustworthy as context.
- An agent that ignores the bootstrap order may miss important context.
- Markdown rules cannot guarantee compliance; deterministic gates (tests, lint, CI) will be needed later for rules that must never be violated.

## Alternatives considered

### Large reusable initialization prompt

Easy to start, but creates oversized prompts and dependencies on conversations and tools. Rejected.

### Agent-specific documents as independent sources

Makes tool-specific optimization easy but creates policy duplication and drift between `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Rejected.
